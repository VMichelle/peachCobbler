        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <p>About our founder Philip Peach</p>
        <p>In 1912, Philip Peach, age 18, left Arad, Hungary, to join his older brother, Joseph, living in Atlanta, Georgia. He sailed on the Prinz Freidrich Wilhelm from Bremen, Germany. After a 12-day voyage to New York he traveled to Atlanta by train. His brother talked a local cobbler into taking Philip as his apprentice and the rest is history</p>
